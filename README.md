# gwd-starter-theme
 
A very simple WordPress theme for students who are just learning the basics of developing a theme.

This is the parent theme. It is designed to be used with the [GWD Starter Child Theme](https://github.com/JACGWD/GWD-Starter-Child-Theme) and the [CSS Reset Selector plugin](https://github.com/JACGWD/CSS-Reset-Selector).
